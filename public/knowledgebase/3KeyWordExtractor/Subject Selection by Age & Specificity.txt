Purpose
Ensure the most specific, age-revealing, and castable subject is selected for every cinematic b-roll keyword phrase.
________________________________________
✅ Subject Decision Logic
1.	Identify age-related cues
 Look for descriptors like:
 "elderly", "young", "teen", "wrinkles", "gray hair", "little", etc.

2.	Use gender cues if present
 Determine whether the subject is male or female if explicitly or implicitly indicated.

3.	Consider familial or relational context
 Use roles like father, mother, grandmother, daughter when suggested by the context.

4.	Default to the most visually castable version of the subject
 Always choose a specific, age-indicative term over generic ones.

________________________________________
❌ Avoid
Generic, vague, or abstract subject labels:
●	person

●	adult

●	Even woman or man when more specific terms like grandmother, girl, or boy apply.
